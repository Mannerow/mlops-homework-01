## DataTalk's MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 1 Homework

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict NYC taxi trip durations using scikit-learn and NYC Yellow Taxi data. The pipeline ingests data, processes it by computing trip durations and removing outliers, and applies one-hot encoding to location features. A linear regression model is then trained on the processed data, and the model's performance is evaluated using RMSE on both training and validation datasets. The results, including the size of the feature matrix and model performance metrics, are logged throughout the pipeline.
